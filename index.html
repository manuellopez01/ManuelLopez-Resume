        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an eighteen year old first year college student attending the university of california riverside. I plan on studying business, but have interests in science such as neuroscience and biology. I grew up in San Diego, California and spent the majority of my childhood there. Throughout high school I played baseball, basketball, and ran cross country.  Was also part of the national honors society my junior and senior year. I am Christian and devote time to my church weekly. I have had three jobs throughout my teens years. The jobs I have had are working at in-n-out burger as an associate for almost a year. It is my current job right now.<br><br>

        I also worked for a summer camp my junior year summer in high school for a martial arts studio. My other job experience is in retail for a vintage clothing store based in San diego. I have a close knit family and one older sister. I enjoy spending time with my friends, going skateboarding, and going on hikes or the beach. I enjoy the outdoors very much and would choose it over a day inside. I enjoy school work and take my education pretty seriously. On average, since being in college I have averaged about 17 units each quarter and I plan on graduating on time in these next four years. In my free time I usually am either being active or playing video games. I am not too sure about what i want to do after college but i know i want to help others. I want a job that will not only provide me with funds but that will help me provide others with smiles. My passions include baseball, friends, and skateboarding. I have played baseball for 6 years and my positions include shortstop, second base, and pitcher. During my high school playing years, My accolades included pitcher of the year and offensive player of the year. While playing basketball, I was awarded defensive player of the year the second year I played varsity.<br><br>

        In regard to my education during my high school years, I was part of the honor roll all four years by maintaining above a 3.5 gpa every semester of each academic year. I also was awarded the presidential award my senior year and awarded a graduation cord for being in the top ten percent of my class. Some of my working skills include being attentive to any issues that occur in the workplace while also remaining calm and taking action. I am very kind to both fellow workers and customers. I work diligently and neatly. I respect all that enter an establishment and try my best to do what I can for others in order to meet their requests. Because of my qualities in the workplace, i have received a raise two times at my in n out job that I currently have. No matter what job or future endeavours i may have in the future, I always plan on applying these same qualities and mindset in any environment to provide others with the best possible service.
